## ðŸŽ¯ **Method 3: Alternative - Use HTTP Request + Code Nodes**

If you can't install the Playwright node, we can use the existing **HTTP Request** and **Code** nodes to achieve similar results:

### **Workflow Structure:**
1. **Webhook** â†’ Receive search query
2. **HTTP Request** â†’ Fetch the search page HTML
3. **Code Node** â†’ Parse HTML and extract movie data
4. **Respond** â†’ Return results

---

## ðŸ”§ **Verification Steps**

### **After Installation:**
1. **Check Node Palette**: Look for "Playwright" in the node list
2. **Create Test Workflow**: Try adding a Playwright node
3. **Test Execution**: Run a simple page navigation test

### **Test Code:**
```javascript
// Simple test in Playwright node
return await page.evaluate(() => {
  return {
    title: document.title,
    url: window.location.href
  };
});
```

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Installation Fails:**
1. **Check n8n version** - Ensure you're running a recent version
2. **Check permissions** - Make sure you have admin access
3. **Check logs** - Look for error messages in n8n logs
4. **Try alternative method** - Use HTTP Request + Code approach

### **Common Issues:**
- **Permission denied**: Run with sudo or check user permissions
- **Network issues**: Check if your server can access npm registry
- **Version conflicts**: Update n8n to latest version

## ðŸŽ¬ **Next Steps After Installation**

1. **Import the Playwright workflow** I created
2. **Test with a simple query** like "rrr"
3. **Verify real poster extraction** is working
4. **Update your main application** to use the new endpoint
