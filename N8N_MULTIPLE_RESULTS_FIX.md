# 🔧 Fix N8N Workflow to Return Multiple Results

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
Your N8N workflow is only returning 1 movie result instead of multiple results, even though:
- The workflow finds multiple movie URLs (6+ movies)
- The microservice is working correctly
- The backend expects multiple results

## 🎯 **Root Cause**
The issue is in the N8N workflow execution. The workflow is correctly extracting multiple movie URLs, but only processing the first one through the microservice.

## ✅ **Solution**

### **Step 1: Import the Fixed Workflow**
1. **Download** the fixed workflow: `n8n_fixed_multiple_results_workflow.json`
2. **Go to your N8N instance**: https://n8n-7j94.onrender.com
3. **Import the new workflow**:
   - Click "+" → "Import from File"
   - Upload `n8n_fixed_multiple_results_workflow.json`
4. **Activate the workflow**

### **Step 2: Key Changes Made**
The fixed workflow includes:
- ✅ **Better parallel processing** of multiple movie URLs
- ✅ **Improved error handling** for microservice calls
- ✅ **Enhanced result combination** logic
- ✅ **Proper handling of all extracted URLs**

### **Step 3: Test the Fixed Workflow**
```bash
# Test with multiple results
curl "https://n8n-7j94.onrender.com/webhook/search-movies?query=rrr&max_results=10"

# Should now return multiple movies instead of just 1
```

## 🔍 **Expected Results After Fix**
- **Before**: 1 movie result
- **After**: 5-10 movie results (depending on search)

## 🎬 **What Should Happen**
1. **Extract Movie URLs**: Finds 6+ movie URLs
2. **Call Microservice**: Processes ALL URLs in parallel
3. **Combine Results**: Returns ALL processed movies
4. **Final Response**: Multiple movies with streaming URLs

## 🚀 **Alternative Quick Fix**
If you can't import the new workflow immediately, you can:

1. **Increase timeout** in the microservice call node to 60 seconds
2. **Check the "Execute Once for All Items"** setting in the microservice node
3. **Verify the "Combine Results" node** is processing all input items

## 📊 **Testing Commands**
```bash
# Test N8N directly
curl "https://n8n-7j94.onrender.com/webhook/search-movies?query=rrr&max_results=15"

# Test your full app
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/search?query=rrr"

# Check logs for multiple results
python3 integrate_n8n_backend.py
```

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**
✅ N8N returns 5+ movies instead of 1  
✅ Each movie has a streaming URL  
✅ UI displays all results  
✅ No timeout errors  

Once this is fixed, your movie search app will show multiple results from both Playwright and N8N sources!
