# N8N URL 404 Error - Diagnosis and Solution

## üîç Problem Diagnosis

After thorough testing, I've identified the root cause of the 404 errors:

### Issue Summary
- **Primary Problem**: The n8n workflow is returning **hardcoded/fake video IDs** instead of extracting real streaming URLs from movie pages
- **Secondary Problem**: The "n8n-" prefix makes the URLs even more invalid, but removing it doesn't solve the core issue
- **Evidence**: All tested URLs (both with and without n8n- prefix) return 404 errors

### Test Results

## üõ†Ô∏è Root Cause Analysis

The n8n workflow has several issues:

1. **Hardcoded Response**: The "Respond" node contains hardcoded movie data with fake video IDs
2. **No Real URL Extraction**: The workflow doesn't actually extract streaming URLs from movie pages
3. **Broken Logic Flow**: The "Extract Streaming URL" node exists but its output isn't used in the response

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Option 1: Fix the N8N Workflow (Recommended)
Update the n8n workflow to:
1. Remove hardcoded responses
2. Actually extract real streaming URLs from movie pages
3. Use the extracted URLs in the response

### Option 2: Use Only Playwright Scraper
Since the Playwright scraper works correctly, disable n8n integration temporarily:
```python
# In integrate_n8n_backend.py
async def fetch_from_n8n(query: str, max_results: int = 20) -> List[Dict]:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è n8n integration disabled due to URL issues")
    return []  # Return empty results
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
Use Playwright for URL extraction and n8n for other processing:
1. Let Playwright extract real streaming URLs
2. Use n8n for additional metadata processing
3. Combine results properly

## üîß Implementation

I've created a fixed n8n workflow (`n8n_movie_search_workflow_fixed.json`) that:
- Removes hardcoded responses
- Implements proper URL extraction logic
- Uses dynamic responses based on actual extracted data

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Import the fixed workflow** into your n8n instance
2. **Test the workflow** with real queries
3. **Verify URL extraction** is working correctly
4. **Update the webhook URL** in `integrate_n8n_backend.py` if needed

## üß™ Testing Commands

```bash
# Test the fixed n8n integration
python3 integrate_n8n_backend.py

# Test individual URLs
python3 tmp_rovodev_test_real_n8n_urls.py
