# Playwright Microservice Deployment Guide

## üöÄ **Quick Solutions to Make Microservice Public**

### **Option 1: Use Render.com (Recommended - Free)**

1. **Create account** at https://render.com
2. **Connect your GitHub** repository
3. **Create new Web Service**:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements_microservice.txt && playwright install chromium`
   - Start Command: `python playwright_microservice.py`
   - Port: `8002`
   - **Important**: Make sure the build command installs browsers BEFORE starting the service
4. **Deploy** - you'll get a public URL like `https://your-app.onrender.com`

### **Option 2: Use Railway.app (Free)**

1. **Create account** at https://railway.app
2. **Deploy from GitHub**
3. **Add environment variables** if needed
4. **Get public URL**

### **Option 3: Use ngrok (Local tunnel)**

```bash
# Install ngrok
brew install ngrok  # macOS
# or download from https://ngrok.com

# Start tunnel
ngrok http 8002

# Copy the public URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

### **Option 4: Use localtunnel (Simple)**

```bash
# Install localtunnel
npm install -g localtunnel

# Start tunnel
lt --port 8002

# Copy the public URL
```

## üîß **Update N8N Workflow**

Once you have a public URL, update the microservice URL in the n8n workflow:

```javascript
microserviceUrl: 'https://your-public-url.com'  // Replace with your actual URL
```

## üéØ **Test the Setup**

1. **Test microservice directly**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://your-public-url.com/health"
   ```

2. **Test streaming extraction**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://your-public-url.com/extract?url=https://www.5movierulz.chat/grrr-2024-malayalam/movie-watch-online-free-3209.html"
   ```

3. **Test n8n workflow**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://n8n-7j94.onrender.com/webhook/search-movies?query=rrr"
   ```

## üöÄ **Quick Start with ngrok**

If you want to test immediately:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start microservice
python3 playwright_microservice.py

# Terminal 2: Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 8002

# Copy the ngrok URL and update n8n workflow
# Import and activate the updated workflow
```

## üêõ **Troubleshooting Playwright Deployment**

### **Error: "Executable doesn't exist at /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium..."**

This means Playwright browsers weren't installed during deployment. Solutions:

1. **For Render.com**:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements_microservice.txt && playwright install chromium`
   - Make sure the build command runs BEFORE the start command

2. **For Railway.app**:
   - Add a `start_microservice.sh` script with browser installation
   - Or use the provided Dockerfile

3. **For Docker deployment**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t playwright-microservice .
   docker run -p 8002:8002 playwright-microservice
   ```

4. **Local testing**:
   ```bash
   # Install browsers manually
   playwright install chromium
   
   # Then start the service
   python playwright_microservice.py
   ```

### **Error: "Browser launch failed"**

Add these environment variables for cloud deployment:
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/app/.cache/ms-playwright`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=false`

## üìã **Files Needed for Deployment**

- `playwright_microservice.py` - Main service
- `requirements_microservice.txt` - Dependencies
- `n8n_with_microservice_workflow.json` - N8N workflow
- `start_microservice.sh` - Startup script (optional)
- `Dockerfile` - Container deployment (optional)

## üé¨ **Expected Results**

Once deployed, you should get:
- **Real streaming URLs** extracted by Playwright
- **Multiple movies** from dynamic scraping
- **Reliable extraction** without n8n JavaScript limitations
